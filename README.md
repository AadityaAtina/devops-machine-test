# DevOps Machine Test — Azure Microservices Deployment

## Objective

Design and implement a production-ready deployment pipeline on Microsoft Azure for a simple microservices-based application with full observability, security, and failure handling.

---

## Scenario

Your team owns a small internal application that must run on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The application consists of three parts:

- **Frontend** — React or static web app
- **Backend API** — Node.js or Python
- **MySQL Database**

You are expected to provision infrastructure, containerize services, deploy them to AKS, configure CI/CD, and demonstrate observability and security practices.

**Timebox: 8–12 hours**

---

## ⚠️ Important — Debugging Requirement

After scaling the backend to **5 or more pods**, the application becomes **unstable**.

You must:
1. Reproduce the issue
2. Identify the root cause
3. Fix the issue
4. Clearly explain the debugging process, findings, and resolution in the README

---

## What is Already Provided

- `frontend/` — Basic static frontend app (Dockerfile partially complete)
- `backend/` — Node.js Express API with MySQL connection (intentional bug present)
- `k8s/` — Partial Kubernetes manifests (probes, limits, secrets wiring incomplete)
- `terraform/` — Partial Terraform (Resource Group + VNet done; AKS, ACR, MySQL, Key Vault are TODOs)
- `azure-pipelines.yml` — Pipeline scaffold (stages present, steps incomplete)

---

## Requirements

### 1. Infrastructure (Terraform)

Provision the following using Terraform:

- Resource Group
- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Azure Database for MySQL
- Azure Key Vault (preferred) or equivalent secure secret mechanism

### 2. Containers (Docker)

- Dockerize frontend and backend services
- Push images to ACR
- Use production-ready, multi-stage Dockerfiles
- Use non-root containers where possible
- Keep images reasonably optimized

### 3. Kubernetes

Deploy the application to AKS with:

- Separate frontend and backend Deployments
- Ingress configuration (expose frontend and backend)
- Readiness and liveness probes
- Resource requests and limits
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
- Proper service-to-service connectivity
- Secure DB configuration (no hardcoded credentials)

### 4. CI/CD (Azure DevOps Pipelines)

Set up Azure DevOps Pipelines to:

- Run validation/build/test steps
- Build Docker images
- Push images to ACR
- Deploy to AKS
- Verify rollout success and perform health checks after deployment
- Fail safely and support rollback or recovery handling

### 5. Security

- Do **not** hardcode secrets in source code, Terraform, or Kubernetes manifests
- Use Key Vault / Managed Identity / secure secret integration where appropriate
- Store DB credentials securely

### 6. Monitoring & Alerts

Configure:

- Azure Monitor integration
- Basic logs and metrics visibility
- Alerts for unhealthy or failing workloads

## Evaluation Criteria

| Area | Points |
|------|--------|
| Terraform infrastructure design | 20 |
| Dockerization | 10 |
| Kubernetes deployment quality | 20 |
| CI/CD pipeline | 20 |
| Security and secrets handling | 10 |
| Monitoring and alerts | 10 |
| Debugging and scaling fix | 10 |
| **Total** | **100** |

---

## Bonus Points

- Helm chart instead of raw manifests
- Separate environments (dev / staging / prod)
- Remote Terraform state
- Managed Identity integration
- Canary or blue-green deployment strategy
- Automated smoke tests after deployment

---

## Red Flags

- Hardcoded secrets or passwords
- No probes, no HPA, or no resource limits
- No deployment verification
- No explanation of the instability root cause
- Weak Terraform structure with no variables or outputs
- Missing observability or alerting setup

---

## Deliverables

Submit a GitHub repository containing:

- Application source code (frontend + backend)
- Dockerfiles
- Kubernetes manifests or Helm chart
- Terraform code
- Azure DevOps pipeline YAML
- Updated README with:
  - Setup steps
  - Architecture overview
  - Deployment steps
  - Debugging explanation (scaling instability)
  - Assumptions and trade-offs

---

## Submission

Fork this repository, complete the task on your own branch, and share the repository or branch URL along with a **short explanation of your approach**.

> A strong candidate finishes in 4–5 hours. The timebox is 8–12 hours. Correctness, security, clarity, and reasoning matter more than speed.
